# Houses Prices Prediction

This project presents a code/kernel used in a Kaggle competition.

The goal of the competition was to predict the final price of houses from 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

Data source: The [Ames Housing dataset](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education.
